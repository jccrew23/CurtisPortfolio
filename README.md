# CurtisPortfolio

# Overview

This web app is a React/NodeJS project that renders a base portfolio for my future projects, experience and education that I can send to potential clients and employers. The web app uses vite to create the server.

# Web Pages

This portfolio is rendered on one page but is available for navigation throught the nav bar at the top. As demonstrated in the demo video above, when each navigation item is selected by the user, it will scroll smoothly to that section of the page. I feel that this is more user friendly and aesthetically pleasing than having multiple HTML pages. 

# Development Environment

This web was developed using VS Code as the code editor. NodeJS, React & Vite were used for code creation, server starting and rendering of the code. Code was written in JavaScript, JSX, CSS, HTML and JSON. The React library was crucial to creating this page. In addition, vite and fontSource were used.

# Future Work

* Add a database instead of rendering information from a JSON file and adding a feature to allow for editing of projects, education and skills etc. with the database. 
* Add more appropriate projects as I complete more portfolio ready projects
* Add experience as I gain experience. 
* Publish to the web
* Actually send an email to me for the contact form
